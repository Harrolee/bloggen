// site.info is edited on every "sync" operation
// ^^ aka when the user saves their site
// can save locally and globally

// config file will need to reconcile itself against future versions
// current plan:
// newest config file wins
// If we are pushing to a sink and we find a newer config file there,
//opt.A: tell the user and show a diff of the two config files
//opt.B: tell the user, save the older config as `old.config`, and keep the new config
